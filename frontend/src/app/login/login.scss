/* No custom SCSS is strictly needed with Tailwind CSS for the current login/register design. */
/* All styling is applied directly in login.html using Tailwind utility classes. */

/*
   You can use this file for:
   - Defining custom CSS variables (e.g., for consistent branding colors).
   - Adding complex animations or transitions not easily achievable with Tailwind's utility classes.
   - Overriding specific Tailwind default styles if necessary.
   - Styles for pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) or specific states (:focus, :active) if not handled by Tailwind.
